# Creating-an-HTML-Form-and-PHP-Based-Database-Connection
This project involves developing an HTML login form for user input and leveraging PHP to connect to a database. Users enter their credentials via the HTML form, which PHP processes and stores in the database.

This project consists of three key files:

HTML Login Form - Collects user data through a web interface.
Database Connection - A PHP file that establishes a connection to the database.
Data Storage - A PHP file that processes and stores the user data in the database.
Together, these files enable a complete system for user login and data management.
